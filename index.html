 		<h1>Branches</h1>

    <p>Branches in Git are incredibly lightweight as well. They are simply pointers to a specific commit - nothing more. 
    </p>
    <p>This is why many Git enthusiasts chant the mantra:

    branch early, and branch often</p>

    <p>Because there is no storage / memory overhead with making many branches, it's easier to logically divide up your work than have big beefy branches.</p>

    <p>When we start mixing branches and commits, we will see how these two features combine. For now though, just remember that a branch essentially says "I want to include the work of this commit and all parent commits.</p>
